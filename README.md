## Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction Project is a machine learning application developed to predict diabetes in patients using key health indicators. The prediction model uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes various features like glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and other relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is publicly available on Kaggle. It consists of the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Binary variable (1 if diabetic, 0 otherwise).

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 0.7532
- **Precision**: 0.6491
- **Recall**: 0.6727
- **F1 Score**: 0.6607

These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying diabetic patients while minimizing false positives and negatives.

## Usefulness and Applications

The Diabetes Prediction Project provides a practical tool for healthcare professionals and researchers. The model's predictions can help in:

1. **Early Diagnosis**: Identifying individuals at risk of diabetes early, allowing for timely intervention and management.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assisting healthcare providers in prioritizing resources and patient care based on predicted risk levels.
3. **Public Health Insights**: Providing data-driven insights into the prevalence of diabetes and its correlation with various health factors.

The model can be integrated into healthcare systems to provide quick and accurate assessments, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare services.
